# [Fitness Cookbook]() 

### A website to help the hungry stay healthy and fit in the kitchen and in life. This site focuses on calories, popularity and cooking time so the user can get the recipe they need and start cooking right away.

### UX

I created this website to help hungry people who are looking to eat healthy and help decide what to eat. I made it so users who would be ready to cook in the kitchen would have the information they needed and nothing else.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**

- **CSS**

- **Bootstrap**  - The project uses bootstrap for the navbar, modals, and responsiveness.

- **jQuery**  - The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

- **Google Fonts**  - The project uses Google fonts in order to use the Roboto Font.

- **Font Awesome**  - The project uses Font Awesome in order to display various icons for social media and the hamburger menu in mobile view.

- **Python** - This project uses python to execute the logic.

- **Flask** - This project uses Flask to display the webpages.

### Testing

This site was tested across various browsers and browser sizes. Multiple times I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to double check my JavaScript and [W3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/)  to debug and remove extra tags in my code. I used [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com) to check the responsiveness of my site in various devices.

Automated testing using Jasmine was not used as there is little JavaScript logic in the site. The only JS written excluding what came with the theme came from materialize which was the sidenav for mobile use. 

Automated testing using unittest was used to test the routes and connected templates. It can be run by typing the following in the terminal.
```
python3 tests_run.py
```

### Deployment to Heroku

**Name: Fitness Cookbook**

**URI:**https://cook-book-application.herokuapp.com/

This website was deployed through Heroku directly from the master branch.  The difference between the development version and deployment version are little to none. The database is stored on mongodb and is set up through Heroku. Using a Procfile and a requirments.txt file Heroku installs the required software in order to run the site. To get the site to run with Heroku do the following to create the required files.

- **Creating Requirments.txt** - run the following in the terminal.
 ``` 
sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
 ```

- **Creating Procfile** - run the following in the terminal.
```
echo web: python > Procfile 
```
- **Login in to Heroku** - Through the terminal you can use to login and to check the app.
```
heroku login
heroku apps
```
 - **Initialize git** - Initialise git and set the remote for Heroku.
```
git init
heroku git:remote -a cook-book-application
```
- **Push to Heroku** - Finally push to Heroku.
```
git push heroku master
```
- **Don't Forget!** - In heroku's settings under *Config Vars* set the **IP to 0.0.0.0** and the **PORT to 5000**.


### Things to do in the Future

- More Recipes with better photos.

### Credits

I had trouble finding pictures that matched the recipes, so I used the best image from google image search.

### Acknowledgements
